# Coursera-Student-Adviser
Capstone project
WARNING - This chatbot has been developed as the Capstone project for the course, Building AI Applications with Watson APIs. The chatbot is intended to be compliant wiht the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regime.

The chatbot will welcome you if you click on the following link:


I have also provided some screenshots which may be of assistance.
The improvements made to the base model as developed in accord with the instructions include:
1. with the assistance of fuzzy matching, which augments the ability of Watson Assistant to recognise misspelled entity values, and the use of slots, we have installed some background questions to facilitate the Chatbot addressing the enquirer questions.
2. an escalation process has been formalised - if the chatbot cannot provide an answer satisfactory to the prospective student, at first instance, the coursera help web site is hyperlinked, and secondly, access to human interaction is available.
3. the Professional Certificate sector has been augmenbted by a university sector with links to which universities accepte credit for Coursera courses

I believe that these enhancements will assist students in finding the most appropriate courses to fufill their objectives
